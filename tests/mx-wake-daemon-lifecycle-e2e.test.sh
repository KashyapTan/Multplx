# tests/mx-wake-daemon-lifecycle-e2e.test.sh - the watcher + supervise-daemon
# lifecycle, end to end, over one shared state root and a shimmed tmux:
#
#   routine status -> self-handled, queued
#   terminal status written while the watcher is DOWN -> caught on restart (catch-up)
#   drain queued records -> exactly ONE maintainer-relevant digest is buffered
#   housekeeping catch-all scan -> NO duplicate digest
#   buffered digest flushes to the supervisor pane as exactly ONE submission
#   stale working-pane: transient (self + marker) -> persistent (escalates once,
#     clears its marker) -> resumed/busy (clears without escalating)
#
# This proves the operator-visible routing/queueing/dedupe behavior through real
# mx-watch.sh runs plus the daemon's own functions. The maintainer-relevant
# status-phrase matrix and the lock-primitive races stay as focused units
# (mx-daemon.test.sh, mx-watcher-lock.test.sh) - an e2e cannot deterministically
# cover a race, and the phrase list is a product contract worth a dedicated test.
