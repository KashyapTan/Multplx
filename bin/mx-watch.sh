#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Multplx watcher.
# Classifies supervision wakes in bash. In normal mode it absorbs benign wakes
# and keeps blocking; it queues and exits only for actionable wakes.
# The no-verb signal and stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: a wake
# is absorbed only when the actor shows POSITIVE evidence it is still working (an
# actively-running no-mistakes step, or a backend busy signal), and surfaced
# otherwise, so an actor that finishes (or stops and waits) without a current
# working signal is never silently swallowed. A declared external-wait pause is
# the separate idle absorb case and re-surfaces only on its long bounded cadence,
# although its initial no-verb status signal still surfaces in normal mode.
# While state/.afk exists, the daemon owns triage and this watcher queues and exits
# on every wake. Printed reason lines:
#   signal: <file>...      status/turn-end signals, surfaced when a listed status
#                          has a maintainer-relevant verb OR a no-verb signal's actors
#                          is not provably working, unless afk is active
#   stale: <window>        a native-working or attributed-run stale is absorbed with
#                          a wedge timer even when an older maintainer-relevant report
#                          remains, but a regex-only busy pane cannot override a
#                          schema-valid terminal report. A declared
#                          external-wait pause is absorbed instead with its own long
#                          re-surface cadence, never as a wedge, unless a stronger
#                          native blocker arrives. Only when neither
#                          absorb class applies does the resolved current state decide:
#                          terminal (maintainer-relevant) or non-terminal (no verb),
#                          both surfaced at once. A provably-working stale past the
#                          wedge threshold also surfaces, with an "escalation N"
#                          count in the reason; at MX_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT
#                          consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the reason
#                          also carries a "demand-deep-inspection" marker so the
#                          wake payload itself, not just repetition, forces a
#                          closer look instead of another routine supervision
#                          resume. Unless afk is active.

# poll sleeps are interruptible, and every early return runs the ordinary scan.
# Native Herdr waits remain bounded and unchanged, SIGNAL_GRACE remains a plain
# coalescing sleep, and polling remains the permanent durable-state backstop.

# working: note or turn-end while a pipeline runs, a no-change heartbeat). Rather
# than wake broker's LLM for each, this watcher classifies every wake in bash
# and ABSORBS the benign majority - it advances the suppression marker, logs to a
# debug log, and keeps blocking WITHOUT enqueuing or exiting. The no-verb signal
# / stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: such a wake is absorbed ONLY
# while the actor shows positive evidence it is still working (native runtime
# state, an actively-running no-mistakes step, or a busy pane, via actor_is_provably_working over
# mx-actor-state.sh); an actor that stopped its turn with no running pipeline and no
# busy pane is SURFACED, so a finish reported only through interactive pane menus
# (no done: status) is never swallowed. An ACTIONABLE wake (a maintainer-relevant
# signal, a no-verb signal whose actor is not provably working, any check, a stale
# pane whose actor is not provably working, a provably-working stale past the
# threshold, or anything unknown) is written to the durable queue and exits, which
