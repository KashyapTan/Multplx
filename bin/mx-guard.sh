# Watcher liveness and worktree-tangle guard, called by supervision scripts, by
# mx-wake-drain.sh after it empties queued wakes, and by mx-session-start.sh in
# read-only advisory mode whenever session-lock ownership was not verified.
# First, always warn if the broker primary checkout (MX_ROOT) is on a named
# non-default branch, because that means Multplx-on-itself work landed in the
# primary instead of an isolated worktree.
# Then, if any task is in flight (a state/<id>.meta exists) and the watcher's
# liveness beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat, touched every poll cycle) is
# missing or older than MX_GUARD_GRACE seconds, prints a loud, clearly delimited
# banner so the agent cannot skim past it in the tool output of whatever it was
# doing - the one channel every harness has. The full banner is emitted once per
# distinct staleness episode in this MX_HOME (keyed to beacon mtime or absence);
# later guarded commands in the same episode print a one-line reminder instead.
# Episode state lives only under state/.guard-watcher-stale-banner (volatile,
# bounded). Independent alarms (queued wakes, worktree tangle) are never
# suppressed by that dedup. Normal wake handling (watcher briefly down between a
# wake and the next supervision resume) stays inside the grace window and stays
# silent. Always exits 0: the guard warns, it never blocks.
